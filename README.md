# TelegramRobot

This TelegramBot was developed inspired by a [Toptal blog post](https://www.toptal.com/python/telegram-bot-tutorial-python). And is up and running right now, you can talk to the bot going to Telegram App and searching by @imdrobot. This small project was created to test and learn more about Python API's ( and for fun :D ).

## How to Setup and use this code

You need only to update this fields with your bot info:

**credentials.py**
```
bot_token = "<BOT_TOKEN_HERE>"
bot_user_name = "<BOT_USERNAME_HERE>"
URL = "https://<HEROKU_APP_NAME_HERE>.herokuapp.com/"
```
